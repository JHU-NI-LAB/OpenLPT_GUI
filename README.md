# OpenLPT 2.0

OpenLPT 2.0 is a new version of particle tracking code. It can be used for tracking dense tracers, polydisperse bubbles and many other objects. 

Look how easy it is to use:
```bash 
# Use in command line
${code_path}/bin/OpenLPT.exe config.txt
```

```python
# Use in python
import pyopenlpt as lpt

# redirect std::cout to python 
redirector = lpt.PythonStreamRedirector() 

config_file = '${path_to_config_file}'
lpt.run(config_file)
```

Please see the sample format of configuration files, camera files and image files in /test/test_STB or /test/test_STB_Bubble.

## Features
- User-friendly interface in python
- Lagrangian particle tracking for multiple objects (point-like particles, spherical particles, etc.)
- Support stereomatching with multiple cameras (at least 2)
- Include multiple test cases for users to test and understand the code
- Better structure for adding new functions


## Installation - Python Version

### Pre-request
1. [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
2. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or
[Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
3. [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) (recommended for faster dependency resolution)
   ```bash
   # Install mamba in the base environment
   conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
   ```
4. (Windows users) [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). **Note: install the c++ development tools**
5. (Linux users) [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/).


### Install OpenLPT

Download the source code from github
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sinchy/pyOpenLPT.git
```

Create a python environment and install dependencies 
(for **Windows** users, it is suggested to use **Anaconda Prompt** finish the following steps).
```bash
conda create -n OpenLPT python=3.11
conda activate OpenLPT

# use mamba to install dependencies (faster than pip)
mamba install -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
conda deactivate
```

Install the package
```bash
cd pyOpenLPT
conda activate OpenLPT
pip install .
conda deactivate
```
Use the package
```python
# conda activate OpenLPT (run in the bash)
import pyopenlpt as lpt 
redirector = lpt.PythonStreamRedirector() 

config_file = '${path_to_config_file}'
lpt.run(config_file)
```

## GUI Usage

OpenLPT provides a graphical user interface for easier interaction with the tracking pipeline.

### Launch the GUI
```bash
conda activate OpenLPT
python gui/main.py
```

The GUI provides modules for:
- **Camera Calibration**: Wand and plate calibration workflows
- **Image Preprocessing**: Background subtraction and image enhancement
- **Tracking Settings**: Configure tracking parameters
- **Tracking**: Run the tracking algorithm with real-time visualization
- **Results**: View and export tracking results

## Installation - CPP Version
Users who want to install the pure cpp version can refer to the file [README_CPP.md](README_CPP.md)
