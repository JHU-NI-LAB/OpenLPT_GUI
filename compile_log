  DEPRECATION: Building 'pyOpenLPT' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'pyOpenLPT'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334
  WARNING: Failed to remove contents in a temporary directory 'C:\Users\tan_s\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-uninstall-k03tl4jn'.
  You can safely remove it manually.
